# 🐙 LLMPET — A Local Multi-Agent Desktop Workspace

[简体中文](README.md) | **English** | [日本語](README_JA.md)

LLMPET is a **local-first multi-agent workspace with a desktop pet as its front door**. It brings **Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and DeepSeek Harness** into one desktop layer where you can watch live state, find and reopen sessions, manage local history, and hand work from one agent to another.

The pet remains the most immediate interface: it reacts while an agent is thinking, using tools, waiting for you, finishing, failing, or resting, and it surfaces the latest reply in a speech bubble. LLMPET now goes beyond observation with unified session management, cross-agent takeover, a local archive and optional backup, usage diagnostics, and explicit user-triggered agent actions.

> **Exact cross-agent boundary:** Claude and Codex do not share a native transcript. LLMPET locally extracts a bounded recent conversation and Git worktree summary, redacts common secrets, writes a temporary handoff packet, and launches the receiving agent with instructions to verify the files, runtime state, and failure paths. Same-provider actions use the official resume or fork flow. DeepSeek Harness is currently a handoff source, not a takeover target.

The interface is available in **Simplified Chinese, English, and Japanese**. Switch languages instantly from the tray menu under `Settings → Language`; no restart is required.

## What it does

- **Live agent state** — see thinking, working, parallel subagents, context cleanup, waiting, errors, completion, and idle time as pet animations.
- **Claude Code approvals** — allow or deny a Claude Code permission request directly from the pet.
- **Claude Code + Codex + DeepSeek Harness sessions** — the main pet can watch all three backends, while Codex and dsh can each use a separate pet with its own skin and position.
- **Unified session workspace** — search and filter live or historical sessions, pin important work, archive noise, inspect context usage, and bring the selected terminal or desktop session forward.
- **Cross-agent takeover** — hand work between Claude and Codex in either direction, or hand a dsh session to Claude or Codex; same-provider sessions use native resume or fork.
- **Local session archive** — index user-owned sessions across all three providers, filter internal subagents, and optionally back up transcripts without overwriting an existing source during restore.
- **Usage dashboard** — inspect real token trends, model breakdowns, Claude API-price-equivalent estimates, a local Codex token ledger, rate-limit windows, diagnostics, and live operations.
- **Three skins** — Octopus 🐙, Pixel Monster 👾, and Salary Cat 🐱.

LLMPET's state machine, metering, permission flow, process reconciliation, and desktop UI are implemented in this repository. Claude Code connects through its public hook system. Codex and DeepSeek Harness integrations are read-only: LLMPET tails their local session files and does not modify Agent configuration.

## How cross-agent takeover works

```text
Source session
├─ same agent ─────► official resume, or official fork while the source is active
└─ another agent ─► recent dialogue + Git status/diff summary + provenance
                     └─ local redacted handoff packet ─► visible target-agent session
```

The packet is deliberately bounded, stored in a `0700` temporary directory as a `0600` file, and removed about two minutes after a successful launch or immediately after a failed launch. It is labeled as handoff context—not a native transcript—and tells the receiving agent to preserve unrelated changes and separate verified facts from unverified claims and remaining risks. Takeover targets are currently Claude Code and Codex; dsh is source-only.

## Run from source

For source deployment, local packaging, permissions, and troubleshooting, see [Deploy LLMPET locally](docs/LOCAL_DEPLOYMENT_EN.md).

Requirements:

- macOS or Windows
- Node.js 18 or newer
- Claude Code and/or OpenAI Codex installed and used at least once

```bash
git clone https://github.com/myunwang/LLMPET.git
cd LLMPET
npm ci
npm start
```

Useful commands:

```bash
npm test                 # full headless regression suite
npm run package:mac:dev  # local ad-hoc-signed macOS package
npm run package:win      # Windows installer + portable ZIP
npm run uninstall:hooks  # remove LLMPET's Claude hooks safely
```

## How the integrations work

### Claude Code

LLMPET registers merge-safe lifecycle and permission hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json`.

- Lifecycle events such as `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `Stop`, and `SubagentStart` are sent to a local server bound to `127.0.0.1`.
- Permission requests stay open until the user chooses allow or deny.
- Local transcripts are scanned incrementally for token counts, model IDs, and timestamps. Streamed usage snapshots are merged by positive delta, and 5-minute / 1-hour cache writes are priced separately. Assistant text is only read when needed for the short reply bubble.

### OpenAI Codex

LLMPET does not install Codex hooks. It incrementally and read-only tails:

```text
~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/*.jsonl
```

It maps rollout events into the same state machine, filters internal subagent threads, restores long-running sessions without replaying old events, and builds a persistent local token ledger from each event's `last_token_usage`. Codex rate-limit windows remain separate; local history is not presented as an OpenAI bill.

### DeepSeek Harness (dsh)

DeepSeek Harness is still a **developer preview** and may make breaking changes. LLMPET fails closed on an unknown session-log version instead of guessing its shape. It installs no dsh plugins; it read-only tails the harness's own session logs:

```text
$DSH_HOME|~/.dsh/sessions/--<project>--/<session>/session.jsonl.zstd
```

Those logs are **concatenated zstd frames** by default, and the Node runtime inside Electron 33 has no zstd API — so LLMPET scans frame boundaries itself and decodes complete frames one by one (bundled pure-JS decoder [fzstd](https://github.com/101arrowz/fzstd), MIT, see `backend/vendor/`), leaving a torn trailing frame for the next poll. A compressed frame has a 32 MiB decode safety limit; a larger frame is logged and skipped while later frames continue, so the watcher cannot remain stuck forever. Uncompressed `session.jsonl` logs (`compression: 'none'`) work too.

`turn/start` means thinking; once the turn's first `tool/call` lands it stays "working"; `turn/end` maps to celebration, interruption, or error by its reason; `approval/asked` shows "waiting for you" (answer it in dsh's own UI); `session/title` supplies the session name, and `assistant/message.usage` plus `request/context.contextWindow` give the context percentage. Subagent logs (`origin: 'subagent'`, `delegationDepth > 0`) are skipped entirely.

Tick **🌊 dsh pet** in the tray to give dsh its own pet with a separate skin, position, and name tag — independent of the Codex pet toggle. Without it the main pet watches dsh too. "Go reply" opens the generic `dsh web` UI (`http://127.0.0.1:3080` by default, override with `LLMPET_DSH_WEB`); it cannot promise to focus one exact historical session. Harness can resume through `dsh --profile tui --resume <id>` only when that optional profile is installed, and the tested rc.6 machine had web/headless only, so LLMPET does not advertise dsh as a takeover target. A dsh session can still be handed off as a source to Claude or Codex. No cost ledger is built for dsh — it can front any provider, so LLMPET reports context only and never displays a made-up `$0` bill.

## Privacy and security

The **📚 Archive** button in the live session panel opens a separate desktop-style session archive. It indexes user-owned Claude Code, Codex, and supported DeepSeek Harness sessions from desktop, CLI, and Harness storage while filtering internal subagent threads. Claude/Codex same-provider sessions use the official resume flow; cross-provider takeover uses a local handoff packet, and dsh is currently source-only. On macOS, LLMPET keeps one Dock entry; clicking it reopens or focuses the archive without creating another instance.

Scheduled local backup is **off by default**. When the user explicitly enables it, Claude, Codex, and DeepSeek Harness transcripts are copied incrementally to `~/.octopus/session-vault` without changing their compression format. Restore only recreates a missing transcript and never overwrites one that still exists. This protects against provider reinstall or deleted local history; it is not cloud sync and does not protect against losing the whole disk.

- The HTTP server binds only to `127.0.0.1`; write endpoints require a random per-run token in addition to loopback, Host, and browser-origin checks.
- Session data, configuration, and usage history stay on the local machine.
- Codex rollout access is read-only.
- Background network access is limited to the optional daily LiteLLM pricing download. A Travel Frog run contacts Anthropic or OpenAI only after you explicitly press **Depart**; `OCTOPUS_NO_NET=1` disables LLMPET's pricing fetch, but does not override a CLI trip you explicitly start.
- Electron runs with `contextIsolation` enabled and `nodeIntegration` disabled.
- Claude hook installation is merge-safe, atomic, reversible, and backed up before uninstall.

## Configuration and development flags

- `OCTOPUS_NO_HOOKS=1 npm start` — launch without changing Claude settings.
- `OCTOPUS_ALLOW_MULTI=1 npm start` — bypass single-instance protection for development.
- `OCTOPUS_NO_NET=1 npm start` — disable all external network requests.
- `OCTOPUS_DEBUG=1 npm start` — expose the local `/debug` endpoint.
- `LLMPET_NO_CODEX=1 npm start` — disable Codex rollout watching.
- `LLMPET_CODEX_DIR=<dir> npm start` — use a custom rollout directory for testing.
- `LLMPET_NO_DSH=1 npm start` — disable DeepSeek Harness session watching.
- `LLMPET_DSH_DIR=<dir> npm start` — use a custom dsh session directory for testing.
